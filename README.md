Hangman
=======

A little experiment in Python - the game of Hangman!

This is a one-player game of Hangman. Players are given 6 incorrect guessed before the man hangs. 

NOTE: Probably should get someone to playtest this. 6 sounds too low, but I wouldn't want it to be too easy.

To create the downloadable version, I used py2exe.
